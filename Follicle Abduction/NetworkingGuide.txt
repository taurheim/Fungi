Let's say we have a checkbox in the menu that we want synchronized.

1. Add NetworkIdentity Component

2. Our checkbox behaviour should inherit from NetworkedObject

public class Checkbox : NetworkedObject {
	// Implementation
}

3. Override Interact():

protected override void Interact() {
	checked = !checked;
}

4. Call NetworkInteract() from somewhere in your code:
void OnMouseDown() {
	NetworkInteract();
}

Think of it like you have this interact method that you want called on both client and server, so you call NetworkInteract to do it for you.

What if you want to pass some information in? For example you want to synchronize a text field?

1. Add NetworkIdentity component

2. Inherit from NetworkedObject

public class TextField : NetworkedObject {
	string lastSentText = "";
	string currentText = "";
	// Implementation
}

NOTE: If you need a Start() method, make sure to call the base implementation as well, like this:

override void Start() {
	base.Start();
	// Child class start methods
}

3. Override Interact(string str)

protected override void Interact(string str) {
	currentText = str;
}

4. Call NetworkInteract(string str) from somewhere in your code:

void Update() {
	// Don't do it every update so we don't lag the hell out
	if (currentText != lastSentText) {
		NetworkInteract(currentText);
		lastSentText = currentText;
	}
}

What if we want to synchronize an object's location?

1. Add NetworkIdentity component
2. Add NetworkTransform component

Note that this will only synchronize the transform, anything else will have to be done using NetworkedObject. You can use them both on the same object.

Also note that if you have object location changing on both the client and server, they will likely conflict and cause weird shit. 
To fix this, just make sure that you have a check so that your behaviour only happens on one of them, like this:

if(customNetworkManager.isHost) {
	// Change transform
}
